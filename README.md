Let's improve the way that people look for and apply for jobs.<br/>

We've decided to create a web-application that bridges the gap between applicants and employers, no longer do people have to trawl through page after page of meaningless and unappealing job listings in their local area.<br/>

The problem is quality, online job listing agencies have a setup where jobseekers are presented with any and all jobs available - while the employers simply have to wait for applicants to show up.<br/>

Our app will make this a two-way street, tailoring which job listings come up in accordance to a few carefully researched and selected questions that take less than 5 minutes to answer.<br/>

We kill two birds with one stone, job listings are filtered not only by personal preference, but also by personal fit. If you're not likely to be hired due to different motivations, personality, or whatever employers may be looking for, the job listing won't be displayed to potential job seekers.<br/>

Not only does this save time for employers cutting out those who aren't deemed to be a good fit, but it also saves the job seeker's time.<br/>

Furthermore, answers to both the generic questionnaire and a set of job role specific questions are submitted as part of the optional application.
